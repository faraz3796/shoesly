Assumption Made:
 - model of product and brand from Design
 - colors will be added in hex color
 - All the idea of model got from design


Challanges
 - As there is no requirement document so it was challenging to make model products and brand
 - From the design it was difficult to design database
 - store cart data without any login
 - Responsiveness for that i used screen utils.

Additional
 - Workload from current company was much so i have to work overtime there so didn't add any additional feature. but if required i can add as many as i can.
